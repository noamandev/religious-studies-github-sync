Read this or else this won't make sense: [[Christianity becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire]]

In the 16th-17th century, The Christians there retaliated against the government stating how strict they were. As a result of Christian oppression, The citizens decided they don’t want religion anymore. Citizens decided that instead of studying ‘the unseen (referring to theology)’, they would study the seeable (referring to concepts like physics and chemistry).

- Religion is now used to bring moral value into people, or as the ‘sanitation service’. Religion is now used to ‘clean the filth in this world’

There are three major shifts in the world:

- God is replaced with the universe
- The study of the soul is replaced with the study of the body
- The afterlife is replaced with the current life (the life on earth)
- People’s morality keeps on shifting
