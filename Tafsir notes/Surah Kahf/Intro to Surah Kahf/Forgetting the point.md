Allah had told the story of the cave to teach the people that resurrection is legit and to teach them a lesson. But the people forgot this. And when the [[7 Sleepers]] died, instead of learning a lesson, the people instead were at a debate for if they should build a masjid at the cave.

- The Christians even painted the [[7 Sleepers]] as ‘holy saints’

We should learn to focus on what Allah emphasis on in his story, rather than asking irrelevant question or questions that don’t focus on the point
