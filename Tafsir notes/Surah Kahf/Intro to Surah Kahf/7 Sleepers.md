The 7 sleepers are a Muslim group of young men

- They were imprisoned by a Roman emperor because they refused to bow down to [[The False Gods]] when commanded to.
- They escaped from prison and took refuge in a Cave in which Allah put them to sleep for centuries.
- In Christianity, they are believed to be [[Martyrs]]
- Without Allah, we wouldn't have known about these strong-minded young men. [[Allahâ€™s Right To Tell The Story]]
