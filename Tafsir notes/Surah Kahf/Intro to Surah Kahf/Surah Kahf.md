Surah Kahf is deemed by scholars to protect from the worst fitnah and from the worst difficulty.

Surah Kahf is divided into 8 sections: Khutbah #1, The story of the cave, Khutbah #2, The story of some gardeners, Khutbah #3, Story of Musa and Khidr, The Story of Dhul Qarnayn, Khutbah #4

The meanings of some of the Ayat in Surah Kahf:

- قَيِّمًۭا لِّيُنذِرَ بَأْسًۭا شَدِيدًۭا مِّن لَّدُنْهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا حَسَنًۭا (2) - This Ayat states that there will be a terrible war, and that the disbelievers will be warned and the believers will be congratulated and rewarded.

- (3) مَّـٰكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَدًۭا - ‘in which they will remain forever’. The reward that the believers will get is Jannah which as the Ayat says they will stay there forever.

- إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا مَا عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ زِينَةًۭ لَّهَا لِنَبْلُوَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا (7)- This Ayat states that [[Dajjal]] will beautify the earth like never before, in order to test who believes in Allah

-  وَإِنَّا لَجَـٰعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيدًۭا جُرُزًا (8)- This Ayat states that after the test of [[Dajjal]], the Day of Judgment will come and only a barren earth will be there.

-  إِذْ أَوَى ٱلْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ فَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةًۭ وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًۭا (10)- This Ayat states that [[7 Sleepers]] prayed to Allah for guidance through their ordeal. The speciality of this Ayat is that we recite this for guidance through the ordeal with Dajjal.

- (11) فَضَرَبْنَا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ فِى ٱلْكَهْفِ سِنِينَ عَدَدًۭا - This Ayat says they Allah put the 7 young men into a deep sleep for many years

- ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَـٰهُمْ لِنَعْلَمَ أَىُّ ٱلْحِزْبَيْنِ أَحْصَىٰ لِمَا لَبِثُوٓا۟ أَمَدًۭا (12)- Then Ayat says that Allah woke them up

- نَّحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ نَبَأَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ ۚ إِنَّهُمْ فِتْيَةٌ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَزِدْنَـٰهُمْ هُدًۭى (13)- This Ayat tells that Allah will tell the story with purpose, truth, and right.

When the 7 sleepers were stuck in the cave, they made a dua which you can see in Ayat 10, ‘رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةًۭ وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًۭا’. In Ayat 14-16 we learn why they even made this dua. And in Ayat 17-18 it explain how the sleep looked like.

In the story after the men wake up they decide to go to a restaurant because they’re hungry. You can see the entire conversation they had in Ayat 19-21.

When the people discovered about this story, instead of learning the lessons of this story they wondered about how many years they slept, or if they should build a monument. Allah explains this from Ayat 22-26.
