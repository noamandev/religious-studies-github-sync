Surah Kahf is deemed by scholars to protect from the worst fitnah and from the worst difficulty.

Surah Kahf is divided into 8 sections: Khutbah #1, The story of the cave, Khutbah #2, The story of some gardeners, Khutbah #3, Story of Musa and Khidr, The Story of Dhul Qarnayn, Khutbah #4

##### The meanings of some of the Ayat in Surah Kahf:

- قَيِّمًۭا لِّيُنذِرَ بَأْسًۭا شَدِيدًۭا مِّن لَّدُنْهُ وَيُبَشِّرَ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ ٱلَّذِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ أَجْرًا حَسَنًۭا (2) - This Ayat states that there will be a terrible war, and that the disbelievers will be warned and the believers will be congratulated and rewarded.

- (3) مَّـٰكِثِينَ فِيهِ أَبَدًۭا - ‘in which they will remain forever’. The reward that the believers will get is Jannah which as the Ayat says they will stay there forever.

- إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا مَا عَلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ زِينَةًۭ لَّهَا لِنَبْلُوَهُمْ أَيُّهُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا (7)- This Ayat states that [[Dajjal]] will beautify the earth like never before, in order to test who believes in Allah

-  وَإِنَّا لَجَـٰعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيدًۭا جُرُزًا (8)- This Ayat states that after the test of [[Dajjal]], the Day of Judgment will come and only a barren earth will be there.

-  إِذْ أَوَى ٱلْفِتْيَةُ إِلَى ٱلْكَهْفِ فَقَالُوا۟ رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةًۭ وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًۭا (10)- This Ayat states that [[7 Sleepers]] prayed to Allah for guidance through their ordeal. The speciality of this Ayat is that we recite this for guidance through the ordeal with Dajjal.

- (11) فَضَرَبْنَا عَلَىٰٓ ءَاذَانِهِمْ فِى ٱلْكَهْفِ سِنِينَ عَدَدًۭا - This Ayat says they Allah put the 7 young men into a deep sleep for many years

- ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَـٰهُمْ لِنَعْلَمَ أَىُّ ٱلْحِزْبَيْنِ أَحْصَىٰ لِمَا لَبِثُوٓا۟ أَمَدًۭا (12)- Then Ayat says that Allah woke them up

- نَّحْنُ نَقُصُّ عَلَيْكَ نَبَأَهُم بِٱلْحَقِّ ۚ إِنَّهُمْ فِتْيَةٌ ءَامَنُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ وَزِدْنَـٰهُمْ هُدًۭى (13)- This Ayat tells that Allah will tell the story with purpose, truth, and right.

##### The Structure of Surah Kahf
When the 7 sleepers were stuck in the cave, they made a dua which you can see in Ayat 10, ‘رَبَّنَآ ءَاتِنَا مِن لَّدُنكَ رَحْمَةًۭ وَهَيِّئْ لَنَا مِنْ أَمْرِنَا رَشَدًۭا’. In Ayat 14-16 we learn why they even made this dua. And in Ayat 17-18 it explain how the sleep looked like.

In the story after the men wake up they decide to go to a restaurant because they’re hungry. You can see the entire conversation they had in Ayat 19-21.

When the people discovered about this story, instead of learning the lessons of this story they wondered about how many years they slept, or if they should build a monument. Allah explains this from Ayat 22-26.
##### The Ring Structure of Surah Kahf
Ring composition is **a way of indicating the unity of a specific episode by means of symmetry**: the first element corresponds to the last, the second to the next-to-last, and so on.

- You can find many examples in Surah Kahf.

We’re going to talking about on example. At the end of the story of the cave Allah gives 6 commands to the Prophet.

- ‘Tell them Allah knows better’
    - ‘Don’t debate about them except with the clearest issues, don’t debate about topics that are ambiguous’
        - ‘Don’t seek a verdict from anybody’
        - ‘Don’t talk about tomorrow’
    - ‘Remember your master when you forget’
- ‘Say Allah will guide you’

Explanation for each individual command

- When you say ‘Allah knows better’, you probably mean to leave the topic alone.
- But you shouldn’t leave every topic alone. Debate in topics which you have solid evidence on, and when you’re opponents attempts to throw you off, remind yourself that your arguments are solid.
- But remind yourself that there are things that you may not no off. For example, as said in the 4th command, ‘Don’t talk about tomorrow’.
- Humans always plan ahead, and sometimes you forget to say ‘Insha’Allah’. So next time, ********************remember your master when you forget********************.
- And sometimes you say that you this item or that item in the future, but one thing you should ask from Allah _****************is for him to guide you even closer to the right path.****************_

How they’re connected

- Command 1 mentions ‘Allah knows better’ and Command 6 says to pray to Allah to bring you closer to guidance. They’re connected in the manner that you should leave debates in which there is no useful aftermath and to instead pray to Allah for guidance
- Command 2 says to only debate about non-ambiguous topics unless you have feasible arguments. You’re goal in an argument is to win and feel superior than your opponent. But Command 5 says that to remember Allah when you forget, meaning that you should remember that ALLAH is the superior, not you. When you win it doesn’t mean that YOU are superior, it means that your ARGUMENTS are superior
- Command 3 says to not seek uncertain knowledge from anybody. But you should remind yourself that you also have things that you’re uncertain about, as mentioned in Command 4
