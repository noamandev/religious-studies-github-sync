After the [[The Flock of Birds (الْأَبَابِيلِ)]] pelted them with stones, they left [[The Army of the Elephant (اصحاب الفیل)]] like "chewed up straw".
- فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍۢ مَّأْكُولٍۭ - "Leaving them like chewed up straw"

After this mega failure, [[Abraha]] went back to Yemen in a disheveled form and later died due to the suffered injuries.
