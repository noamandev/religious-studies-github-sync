When the [[The Army of the Elephant (اصحاب الفیل)]] arrived in Ta'if, [[Abraha]] asked someone to guide him presumably to [[Mecca]]. When the arrived near Mecca, [[The Quraysh]] climbed on top of mountains and say the army, to which they said that they would never be able to defeat them. [[Abd al-Muttalib]] gripped the sides of the doors of the Ka'ba and said:
> O God! Anyone defends his property, so, You defend your house that is the symbol of Your glory and do not allow them to disrespect Your Ka'ba with their Cross and fake Ka'ba. Do not let them enter the sacred city! This is what I think, but what You will, will happen."
