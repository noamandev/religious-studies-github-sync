The attack of [[The Army of the Elephant (اصحاب الفیل)]] happened during his rule in Mecca.

### Abd al-Muttalib's plundered camels
Abraha saw some camels near Mecca and took them for his army, 200 of these camels were Abd al-Muttalib's camels. When Abd al-Muttalib found out his camels were plundered, he went to Abraha's camp and ordered to his camels to be returned.

"I have came here to destroy you religion's house, the house of glory, but instead you ask for your camels instead?" - Abraha said

"Every house has an owner who will protect his house. Allah will protect his house and it is not my duty to protect it" - Abd al-Muttalib said

This response shocked and frightened Abraha so much, that he immediately gave the camels back
