The Qur'an mentioned that there was flocks of birds throwing stones made of baked clay towards [[The Army of the Elephant (اصحاب الفیل)]] as a punishment for them attempting to go to [[Mecca]] and destroy [[The Ka'ba]].
- وَأَرْسَلَ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا أَبَابِيلَ - "For He (Allah) sent against them flocks of birds"
- تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍۢ مِّن سِجِّيلٍۢ - "that pelted them with stones of baked clay"
Allah has sent these birds as a punishment and protected his house. These birds had one stone in their mouth and two stones in both their feet. 
- 'تَرْمِيهِم' means 'striking' and it is in the present continuous, meaning that the stones just kept on falling, similar to rain
