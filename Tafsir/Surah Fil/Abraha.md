Abraha was the king of Yemen and the grandfather of Najashi, he was also the leader of [[The Army of the Elephant (اصحاب الفیل)]]. He was a follower of Christianity. 
### Why did he want to destroy the Ka'ba?
One time he built a building like the Ka'ba and ordered people to circumambulate around it like in Hajj rituals. But they didn't listen, while this was happening the Banu Kinana (a tribe in Mecca) came and polluted this building, only making Abraha more angry. This made him to destroy the Ka'ba and make sure nobody visit's and performs hajj there. So he prepared the army of elephants.

To prevent the Yemeni Arabs from traveling to Mecca, he built a church in San'a and decorated it with gold and jewelry, and forced them to visit it. The church was called “Qilis” and was built to prevent Arabs from traveling to Mecca. But, one of the Yemenis disrespected this church, so Abraha swore to destroy the Ka'ba. However, the spread of Christianity in the western and southern parts of the Arabian Peninsula, as well as the political and economic interests of Rome and Abyssinia, are considered to be the motives of his attack on Mecca
